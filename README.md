# Radix Sorting

## The Project

Usual sorting algorithms have an upper time complexity bound that is O(n.log(n)). Here, we are implementing a ***Radix Sorting Algorithm*** that is able to sort huge sets with a time complexity of O(n). The project is composed of 2 different algorithms: LSD and MSD. It is possible to sort integers or strings, they must be stored in a `.txt` file. You can change the current algorithm (std::sort, LSD, MSD) by commenting or decommenting lines in the `main()` function.
